# NFT-IPFS-minting
Solidity contract and javascript for minting an NFT with IPFS Pinata support

The name of every minted NFT is automatically set to the name + counter.
The javascript function expects metamask to be installed.

The person doing the minting automatically get the minted NFT, though the contract also supports sending the minted NFT to another wallet.
